## Project Overview

This project was commissioned by **John**, a business owner, to help him understand the **mental health challenges** his employees might be facing. Our goal is to analyze trends in **mental health support**, identify **emotionally demanding occupations**, and evaluate **how indoor time impacts well-being**.

## Project Structure

- `project_eda.py`: Main Python script for data analysis 
- `Data/`: Datasets used (referenced in the analysis) 
- `Visualizations/`: Plots and graphs generated during analysis 
- `README.md`: This README explaining the project

---

## Key Algorithms and Techniques

- **Data Cleaning & Encoding**  
  - Handled missing data and converted categorical values (e.g., Yes/No to 1/0).

- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**  
  - Used to measure relationships between job roles, indoor time, and mental health metrics.

- **Linear Regression Analysis**  
  - Explored trends, such as mood swings among self-employed individuals.

- **Heatmaps and Bar Charts**  
  - Provided visual insights into correlations and key findings.

---

## Key Findings

- **Students and housewives** experience the highest levels of mood swings.
- **Corporate employees** are less likely to seek mental health treatment.
- **Self-employed individuals** report fewer mood swings, likely due to greater autonomy.
- **Indoor time** has a small positive correlation with mood swings but minimal impact on other factors.
